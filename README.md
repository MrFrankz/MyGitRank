# MyGitRank
This is my first ReactJs project which allows clients to view a ranked list of repositories on Github and see the details of each response by using Github API.
## How to run this project?
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. `npm install`

## Test environment?
* (Important!)To achieve best experience, 1024*768 resolution is recommanded.
* My test environment is under MacOS 10.12 and Chrome 56.0.2924 (64-bit).
## How does it work?
* Click on any repositories' name on the list and the detail will be shown on the detail view.
* Click the < and > button to perform pagination.
* Type in any interger(number should not be smaller than 1) in the input field, to jump to any page that you want.
* Selecting the language you want in the selection language will give you the repositories in that language.
